Notes on current implementations
Chose to use Fragment for the header with Home and Back buttons, since it would be easier to modularize
Tried to use TabHost to switch between write,draw, and text options, but TabActivity is deprecated.
	ActionBar Tab does not allow tabs to be at the bottom of the screen
